Regression:
- Predict event or predict reward -> Currently event
- Remove data points with reward == 0 ?

- Regression running, but has high mse (1.5 - 2)
- Transfer estimation of i to probability of i by using it as a mean of a poisson distribution
- High buying probability not represented adequately

TODOs:
- Iterative update of optimal policy vs playing random action
