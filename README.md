1. Ensure to install all the requirements from ``requirements.txt``.

2. Select the monopoly or duopoly environment with the boolean variable in ``run.py``.

3. (optional) Change model selection or number of training episodes in ``run.py`` or environment variables in corresponding environment files ``airline_environment.py`` and ``duopoly_environemnt.py``.

4. Start the simulation by executing ``run.py``.
